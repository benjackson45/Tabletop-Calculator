# Tabletop-Calculator

A calculator for various tabletop games

I'll come up with a proper README once I actually figure out how to install and build this, still trying to figure out how Laravel works!

For my reference, open up Herd which will kick up the PHP component. Then just access via [http://tabletop_calculator.test/](http://tabletop_calculator.test/)

npm run build in VS when you make changes
